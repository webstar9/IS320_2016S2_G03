Name of Project: The Night at the Museum

Executive Summary: The Night at The Museum is a system designed for an immersive, mixed reality experience of Auckland Museum. The prototype application that we have built for Auckland Museum supports their aims to enhance the Auckland Museum experience for their users.  The focus of this project, and overall prototype, is to allow the Museums’ users to have a more immersive experience, and be able to provide them with the information and data that they want when they want it. We wanted to ensure this would not be an experience where the technology detracted from the displays and environment of the Museum itself, but rather an additional extension to this experience, with more access to more information, delivered in a simple and direct way. 

We have created this proposal based on the aim of using the Microsoft HoloLens platform, whereby users would still be able to walk around the museum but also be able to be shown information, images/videos and even hear sounds when they interact with this Mixed Reality version of the Museum landscape.

What this porotype, that we developed in Unity, demonstrates is how the we envision a Mixed Reality experience for the Museums’ users to be like, and has a 1st person perspective of walking around the museum.  The playing environment is a basic room, with the different floors of the Museum laid out on the walls, which allows the application users to approach the area/floor that they are interested in and interact with them.  This interaction demonstrates what we are trying to achieve for the overall project, as it is user focused and puts them in control of their Museum experience.
Please see our Unity file to experience our spin of the Museum experience, and also our InVision project which demonstrates what our end goal for the project would be.

Platform: built using Unity 5.4.1f1

Known Issues with our Unity file: The direction of the Soldier prefab and the soldier prefab text points in the wrong direction from user. The scripts are all seperated out, which a few of them could be placed into one script and then use a prefab for the wall objects (basically, the coding could be smarter. The WebGL package builds but does not load, as has Java errors, so this would need to be addressed.
